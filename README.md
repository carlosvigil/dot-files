Use Warp terminal on macOS, Kitty on Linux.
Yabairc config’s tiling window manager on macOS.
"X" files are outdated, so is fre.sh install script.

Currently using Zsh.
I love NixOS, Hyprland, and Neovim. — July, 2023

Still using zsh, moved back to MacOS. NixOS is impractical and a massive time sink.
Neovim also is a time sink with more immediate ROI. Will attempt to use Helix for some time ignoring the plugin/extensibility question. First impressions earlier in the year were that Helix "grammar" was easier and smoother. — November, 2023
