# Les Points

Use Warp terminal on macOS, Kitty on Linux.

I will start logging my experiences so I can build on previous configs, avoid
fomo and hype, and keep things lean.  
Currently using Zsh. I love NixOS, Hyprland, and Neovim.

Still using zsh, moved back to MacOS. NixOS is impractical and a massive time
sink. Neovim also is a time sink with more immediate ROI. Will attempt to use
Helix for some time ignoring the plugin/extensibility question. First
impressions earlier in the year were that Helix "grammar" was easier and
smoother.

The mac mini shorted. Using linux fulltime now. Helix was nicer than vim, but I
started to miss features, and reading some of the repo discussions discouraged
me from having a positive outlook on its future. Configuring was breezier, but
some things didn't have expected nor intuitive behaviour.

Sway and foot isn't so nice. Wezterm was unusable, Kitty is best. Keyd is great,
 but need to test X/Kmonad on current linux deb-trixie and macos. 
I learned how to em dash on linux.
