# Les Points

Use Warp terminal on macOS, Kitty on Linux.

I will start logging my experiences so I can build on previous configs, avoid
fomo and hype, and keep things lean.  
Currently using Zsh. I love NixOS, Hyprland, and Neovim.

Still using zsh, moved back to MacOS. NixOS is impractical and a massive time
sink. Neovim also is a time sink with more immediate ROI. Will attempt to use
Helix for some time ignoring the plugin/extensibility question. First
impressions earlier in the year were that Helix "grammar" was easier and
smoother.

The mac mini shorted. Using linux fulltime now. Helix was nicer than vim, but I
started to miss features, and reading some of the repo discussions discouraged
me from having a positive outlook on its future. Configuring was breezier, but
some things didn't have expected nor intuitive behaviour.  
- i don't know how to em dash on linux, December 23, 2023

Sway and foot isn't so nice. Wezterm was unusable, Kitty is best. Keyd is great,
 but need to test X/Kmonad on current linux deb-trixie and macos.

I switched NixOS again after trying to use debian again. It's far too convenient
to declaratively install apps and have a single file for the majority of the 
system while also not worrying about dependency issues. The trade off is 
configuring certain things with nix and it's syntax, which have been painful at 
times. I switched to Hyprland from Sway because it seems like X-window has many 
core issues. But, since X will probably still "work" I am open to trying Kmonad,
in particular, because I can use it on MacOS, and further because of Haskell. 
Keyd is delightfully simple. I've yet to use waybar or look at other options. I 
also haven't bothered with a display/login/session manager. Or a lock yet.

## TODO:
- fix current waybar
- pick a tiling window manager (currenty on hypr, wondering if xmonad)
- figure out how to connect audio interface
- lookup how to monitor color profile
- add a lock & disable auto-login
