# Les Points

Use Warp terminal on macOS, Kitty on Linux.

I will start logging my experiences so I can build on previous configs, avoid
fomo and hype, and keep things lean.  
Currently using Zsh. I love NixOS, Hyprland, and Neovim.

Still using zsh, moved back to MacOS. NixOS is impractical and a massive time
sink. Neovim also is a time sink with more immediate ROI. Will attempt to use
Helix for some time ignoring the plugin/extensibility question. First
impressions earlier in the year were that Helix "grammar" was easier and
smoother.  
— November, 2023

The mac mini shorted. Using linux fulltime now. Helix was nicer than vim, but I
started to miss features, and reading some of the repo discussions discouraged
me from having a positive outlook on its future. Configuring was breezier, but
some things didn't have expected or intuitive behaviour.
